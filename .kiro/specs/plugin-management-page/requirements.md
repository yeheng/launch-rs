## Introduction

This feature adds a comprehensive plugin management page to the application, allowing users to view, install, uninstall, enable, disable, and configure plugins through a user-friendly interface. The plugin management page will provide centralized control over all plugin-related operations and display relevant plugin information and status.

2. WHEN the user modifies plugin settings THEN the system SHALL validate the input values
3. WHEN the user saves plugin settings THEN the system SHALL persist the configuration

5. IF a plugin has no configurable settings THEN the system SHALL hide or disable the settings button

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to uninstall plugins I no longer need, so that I can keep my application clean and reduce resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on an uninstall button for a plugin THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog

3. WHEN the user confirms uninstallation THEN the system SHALL remove the plugin files and configuration
4. WHEN a plugin is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL remove it from the plugin list
5. WHEN a plugin is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL clean up any plugin-specific data or settings

### Requirement 5
